# VSCode Theme Builder

A dark üê¢ theme inspired by [draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code](https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code)

## Getting started

```js
npm install
mkdir bin
npm run package // to test if your build works
```

## Theming

To start building your own theme, just add your very own `.yml` file to `src` alongside `src/oogway.yml`

Hit `F5` on your keyboard to begin debugging on VSCode.

Once you are ready, feel free to create a PR.
